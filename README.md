# TFG-SignalSegmentation

Framed in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), there is the widely discussed
subject of audio-based Music Structure Analysis (MSA), where the Signal Segmentation
Problem would be located. This field of research consists of the study of techniques capable
of imitating the human perception of high-level structures that constitute a song. In other
words, they aim to be able to identify where one section of the song begins and another
ends, in a similar way to how a human listener would perceive it.
In this thesis, we present several implementations in the field of Music Segmentation. The
first one consists of a revision of an offline segmentation technique, in which some new
features have been implemented, thus improving its performance.
Going one step beyond the conventional form of this problem, thus seeking new lines of
development, a novel real-time segmentation algorithm has also been implemented, which
allows the exploration of the aforementioned high-level structures of a piece while it is
being performed live.
Also, in order to be able to evaluate and analyse the behaviour of the different algorithms,
a data-set has been curated to test the different implementations, an evaluation model has
been designed to quantify the different solutions, and finally, an automatic optimisation
strategy has been implemented to refine the different implementations.
